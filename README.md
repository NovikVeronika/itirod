# Work â„–2 "MockUp" 


I made the MockUp in Figma and the free version allows u to create 3 projects of 3 pages, i'm so sorry for such inconvenience :( but i hope it's not such a big problem

### The first part of the MockUp is [here](https://www.figma.com/file/eM6LuzvfA167lOVRHOOwAI/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1).

- The first page is the **LoginPage**, which is responsible for the user logging into the app.
- If u don't have an account, go to the second page is the **SignUpPage** and register.
- The third page is **LoggedPage**. Here u can start planting the tree by clicking on the button _(perhaps in the process i will add more motivational quotes on this page(: )_.


### The second part of the MockUp is [here](https://www.figma.com/file/f3sFwCj34pjS2lJbBqPbvn/Untitled?node-id=7%3A20).

This part of the MockUp shows all the stages of pine growth, i also added motivational quotes and a **give up** button, and on the last page there is a button that goes **to statistics**.

### The third part of the MockUp is [here](https://www.figma.com/file/wnt1wB8H25Tbbh2iMuk2oa/Untitled?node-id=6%3A112).

- The **ChangeTimePage** is for setting time and start of study.
- The **GiveUpPage**, which shows which tree u will get if u give up, u can delete ur bad result. And also you can check ur statistics by clicking on the button.
- The **StatisticsPage** is for control ur statistics (date, time, grew a pine tree or gave up).

## Main functions of the app

1. **Log in**
2. **Sign up**
3. **Start planting**
4. **Change time** for the user to set the required time
5. **Go to statistics**
6. **Give up**
7. **Delete this Record**
